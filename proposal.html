<h1>Project Proposal</h1>

<h3>What do we want to do?</h3>
<p>
We would like to implement a program that is able to "grow" buildings, gradually refining the visual representation as the viewer gets closer. For this, we would like to model everything as geometry instead of just applying a `facade'-texture to a rough geometric approximation of the building like in [1].
</p>
<h3>What results do we want to show?</h3>
<p>Rendering procedurally generated buildings in real-time, with some kind of LoD.
</p>
<h3>What are the technical problems we have to solve?</h3>
<p>
Investigate different approaches to generate/grow buildings.<br/>
Implement view-dependent LoD.
</p>

<h3>Which steps are necessary to solve those problems?</h3>
<p>
Read up on ways to generate gemetry.<br/>
Find a suitable representation for the geometry, possibly CSG.<br/>
Try out different implementations...<br/>
<br/>
...debugging
</p>

<h3>What third-party software or libraries do we want to use?</h3>
<p>
OpenGL, GLUT
</p>

<h3>What software parts do we implement ourselves?</h3>
<p>
Generation and rendering of the buildings
</p>
